This is the landing page for the GitHub for the Hoover Institution's Fiscal Policy Initiative and State & Local Governance initiative.

<h1>Research Initiatives</h1>
As a policy-oriented enterprise steeped in academic tradition, the Hoover Institution seeks to deploy its unique intellectual resources toward practical and timely applications, focusing on peace, personal freedom, and safeguards to the US system.
<h2>Fiscal Policy Initiative</h2>
The Fiscal Policy Initiative researches potential solutions to the nation’s fiscal policy challenges, providing a road map that promotes future economic growth and opportunity. Led by Senior Fellow Joshua D. Rauh, the initiative launched in 2025 with a conference exploring the economic consequences of US fiscal policy trends, including extensive discussions of budget projections, debt sustainability, international responses to debt crises, the effectiveness of government spending and tax policy, and the interaction between fiscal and monetary policies.
<h2>State & Local Governance Intiative</h2>
The State and Local Governance Initiative at the Hoover Institution conducts rigorous research to inform state and local government policy. Our team partners with government officials, policymakers, and other stakeholders to conduct analysis, generate actionable policy recommendations, and produce top-tier academic publications.
