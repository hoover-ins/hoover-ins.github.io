<h1>Research Initiatives</h1>
As a policy-oriented enterprise steeped in academic tradition, the Hoover Institution seeks to deploy its unique intellectual resources toward practical and timely applications, focusing on peace, personal freedom, and safeguards to the US system.

Hoover has several active teams devoted to conducting research in areas of public policy in line with the Institution’s priorities and the nation’s policy challenges. Research teams host scholar symposia and track 1.5 and 2 dialogues with policy makers and influencers, write working papers, and produce multimedia content including essays, newsletters, and podcasts.
